# Iteration 0002

## Summary
- Excluded MapperApp and ServerApp entrypoints from Android engine sources to avoid ImGui/Mapper dependencies during client-only build.
- Ran Android assemble to verify exclusion; build blocked by proxy while downloading Gradle distribution.

## Files Touched
- app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt
- build_logs/build-ITER-0002.txt
- codex_logs/ITER-0002.md (this log)

## Commands Run
- apply_patch (updated Android source filters)
- ./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug --stacktrace --info | tee build_logs/build-ITER-0002.txt
- git status -sb
- git rev-parse HEAD
- git log -1 --oneline
- git branch --show-current

## Git State
- Status: modified (app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt; new build_logs/codex_logs)
- HEAD: 87323502df60ef10948f1946a15f07f349d0496f
- Last commit: 8732350 Exclude server/editor apps from Android build
- Branch: work

## Build Result
- Failed: Gradle wrapper download blocked by proxy (see build_logs/build-ITER-0002.txt)

## Next Steps
- Re-run assembleDebug in proxied environment after proxy issue resolved; expect build to proceed past MapperApp/ServerApp once Gradle is available.
